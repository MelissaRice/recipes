Rosewater Pudding 

INGREDIENTS
2.5 cups whole milk, divided
3 tablespoons sugar
Pinch of salt
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 tablespoon rosewater
2 tablespoons butter
  
PREPARATION

Put the sugar, salt and 2 cups of milk in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. 
Cook just until mixture begins to steam.

Combine cornstarch and remaining 1/2 cup of milk in a bowl and blend till smooth. 
Add this to the saucepan, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes, until it starts 
to thicken and barely reaches a boil. Reduce heat to very low and stir for about 
5 more minutes until thick. 

Stir in butter and rosewater.

Pour mixture into 4 to 6 small bowls. Refrigerate until chilled.
